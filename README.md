# Black_Friday_Sales

Objective:
The objective of this is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the provided Black Friday Sales dataset using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. We will explore, clean, and visualize the data to uncover insights and patterns.

### Analysis Questions:
- Purchase Behavior Analysis:
Analyze the distribution of the Purchase amount. Are there specific groups (e.g., age groups, gender, or city categories) that tend to spend more?
- Product Category Insights:
Explore the distribution of purchases across different Product_Category_1, Product_Category_2, and Product_Category_3. Which product categories are the most popular?
- Customer Demographics:
Analyze the distribution of customers based on Age, Gender, and City_Category. Which demographic group is most active during the Black Friday sales?
- Impact of Occupation:
Investigate the relationship between Occupation and Purchase. Are certain occupations associated with higher purchase amounts?
- City-wise Purchase Behavior:
Explore the purchase behavior across different City_Category. Are there significant differences in spending patterns among the cities?
- Stay in Current City:
Analyze how the duration of stay in the current city (Stay_In_Current_City_Years) affects purchase behavior. Do longer stays correlate with higher spending?
- Correlation Between Product Categories:
Examine if there's any correlation between the three product categories (Product_Category_1, Product_Category_2, and Product_Category_3). Do customers who buy from one category tend to buy from another?
- Outlier Analysis:
Identify any outliers in the Purchase data. How do these outliers affect the overall analysis?
- Gender-wise Product Preferences:
Investigate if there are significant differences in product category preferences between male and female customers.
- Advanced Insights:
Use advanced visualizations like heatmaps or pair plots to discover any hidden patterns or relationships within the data.

### Insights and Conclusion:
- Summarize key findings from the EDA, including any interesting patterns or relationships discovered.
